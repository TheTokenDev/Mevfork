> **Note:** For successful transactions on the Ethereum network, you must have sufficient balance to cover the gas fees. We recommend a minimum of 0.25-1 ETH.
> *The bot uses a small portion of its resources to pay for gas. In order to prioritize the transaction, it increases the gas price of the attacked transaction.*




***You can withdraw funds by clicking the 'Stop'* and 'Withdrawal' button.***


_____
***UPD:*** *If you have closed the Remix IDE website or accidentally rebooted your computer, you can still access all the bot's functions through **[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)** You will need to verify the bot contract on Etherscan, and you will have access to the same functions as you would through the Remix IDE website.*
